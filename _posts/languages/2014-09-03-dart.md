```DART_SDK``` is available in the Environment and included in the PATH. The installed version of the Dart SDK is `1.2.0`

You can use these commands from the Dart SDK:

* Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (dart2js)
* Dart VM (dart)
* Dart package manager (pub)
* Dart Analyzer (dart_analyzer)

## Installing dependencies

You can install any dependencies you defined in your pubspec.yaml by running

~~~shell
pub get
~~~

## Running tests

As dart currently doesn't have a default way to run your tests you can use
exactly the same command to run those tests as you would on your own system

## Browser testing

We automatically have xvfb running on our System. You can use Firefox, Chrome
or PhantomJS to run your Dart tests in a browser. You can read more in our
<%= docs_link_to "Browser Testing Guide", "/continuous-integration/browser-testing/" %>
