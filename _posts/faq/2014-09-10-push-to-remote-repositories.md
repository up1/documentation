If you want to push to a remote git repository during your deployment steps on Codeship, and the build fails with an error message such as the following:

~~~shell
Writing objects: 100% (1065/1065), 234.32 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 1065 (delta 602), reused 1065 (delta 602)
error: Could not read c70d417b6c0f4536f9a288888e80955b78b1cbc7
fatal: Failed to traverse parents of commit d9ff2fe276d15d485f9c71c309160d47cd4ccdfb
~~~

This is due to the fact, that we perform a *shallow clone* of the repository to speed up build times.

In order to push to a remote repository you have to do a full checkout first. This can be done with the following command:

~~~shell
git fetch --unshallow origin
~~~
