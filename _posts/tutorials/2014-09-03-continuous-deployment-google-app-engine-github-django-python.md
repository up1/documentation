We have a step by step guide on [Continuous Deployment of a Django app from GitHub to Google App Engine](http://blog.codeship.io/2014/01/23/continuous-deployment-google-app-engine-github-python-django.html). Though we are using GitHub in the tutorial it is easy to get this running with BitBucket as your source code provider.

If you are interested in other languages and hosting providers please check out the [Deployment Academy](http://blog.codeship.io/category/deployment-academy) on our blog.
